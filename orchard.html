                <p>My first job I ever had was at Orchard Lanes/Strike & Spare. This bowling alley/restaurant was a good first job as I was a sophomore in high school. I got the job because my godfather was the manager of the bowling alley. I simply asked him for the job, and I got it. My candidate experience ends there.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Zeppoz was my second job. After I left Orchard Lanes due to transferring schools, I applied for a job with this bowling alley. The application process was done with a paper application (I know, retro right?) and got a call about three days later. The manager asked two interview questions and then proceeded to tell me that I already got the job. I was very relieved and happy to hear the news. I figured I would get the job since I already had five years of bowling experience under my belt. </p>

                <h1>Montage</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Montage was my first ever “real life” interview they are an upscale luxury hotel that I found at the fall Career Fair. I talked with them for a half hour during the fair and was invited to interview with them the next day. A month after the interview, I was starting to lose hope. On the fifth week after the interview, I got a call asking to set up a video conference. I received a job offer 4 days after the video call. 
                    All was going great and I had all my onboarding paperwork filled out, but then COVID-19 happened and my job offer was rescinded. I was told to keep a look out on their website and reapply if a job opened up. I was taken back at this statement because I thought they would hold the job for me until operations returned to normal.</p>
