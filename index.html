                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <br>
                <p> Hello! My name is R.J. and I am currently a senior attending the University of Idaho. My degree is a Bachelor of Science in Management and Human Resources with a minor in Accounting. I created this website to document my experiences with job hunting and give pointers of what I’ve learned throughout these encounters. I’ve also documented parts of my life to give a little background about me. I hope my experiences give others something to relate and connect to!  </p>

            <h1>School Involvement</h1>
            <br>
            <p>When I was younger, I played soccer at the Boys and Girls Club. You would be able to spot me because I was the one sitting in the field picking grass and not really doing anything. I think I was just there to relax and enjoy the snacks and refreshments afterwards. I played soccer from 1st grade all the way to 3rd grade. As you can assume, I did not grow up to be an athlete. </p>
            <br>
            <p>As I went along in my schooling, I joined choir in 4th grade at Camelot Elementary. I had a great time being a Camelot Knight and I loved leaving school to go sing at the high school. This experience prompted me to start band in 5th grade playing the trumpet. I finished my elementary school experience by joining morning band in 6th grade. The music instructor made the experience worth while and I loved every minute of it. I ended my musical aspiration here, but that didn’t stop me from joining classes like Percussion and Keyboarding in high school. </p>
            <br>
            <p>During my junior year at Tammany Alternative Center, I joined Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA). My job was to assist others with their projects and provide constructive criticism to their presentations. This experience introduced me to my love of traveling. Throughout my time with FCCLA, we had competitions in Lewiston, Boise, and even went out to Washington D.C.! I was also able to work on my communication skills, specifically in the delivery of bad news. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After FCCLA, I didn’t join another club until my junior year of college. At the University of Idaho, I became a member of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). I wanted to get more involved with my college and after I changed my degree to HR this club made the most sense. When I first joined in the spring, we only had one meeting for the whole semester. This prompted me to run for president for 2019-2020 school year. I got elected co-president and I was able to turn the club around with the help of the leadership team. In our first semester, UISHRM set up opportunities to volunteer at the career fair and had guest speakers from career services and SEL. We even set up a bowling event to promote team bonding! We had so much planned for spring semester, but COVID-19 came along and made things a little difficult to do. Leadership had set up opportunities give back to the community by volunteering at the Boys and Girls Club and the Cottonwood Jail. We had also planned a trip to Alaska for the 2020 HR Leaders of Tomorrow Student Conference. However, we needed to overcome and adapt to this experience and that’s exactly what we did by holding Zoom meetings and sharing internship opportunities.</p>
