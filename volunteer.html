            <p>What most individuals [teens and young adults] don’t realize is that VOLUNTEER WORK IS JOB EXPERIENCE. Mowing lawns, working food banks, babysitting, house/pet sitting: they are all jobs that show you are a responsible citizen and recognize the needs of your community. Below I’ve listed my volunteer experience in hopes to get you inspired to give back. I’ll go in chronological order to show how each job increased in responsibility as I grew both physically and mentally.  </p>

                <p>My first opportunity to volunteer was at my mother's bank at age 10. I was working the snow cone machine 
                    for their annual Summer Bash. Working with all of my moms' coworkers was fun and they were always supportive 
                    if I messed up (as if a 10-year-old would make mistakes). I would be at the site from set up to tear down 
                    making sure that my station was presentable. I would then assist others either by blowing up balloons or 
                    putting out swag items.</p>

                <p>My volunteer experience at the Boys and Girls Club grew as I was doing my senior project in high school. I’ve been a member of the club since I was a kindergartner, so it was only appropriate that I do my volunteer work here. My topic for my senior project was “The Importance of Going on to Higher Education”.  I know… long title. But everyone that worked at the club was either going to college or already had their degree. ANYWAYS I volunteered at this site by serving grilled cheese with the admin, sorting sport and membership renewals, and playing games with the club kids.  </p>

                <p>After I turned 18, I started volunteering at the rodeo grounds and started selling beer/alcohol tokens. This experience definitely opened my eyes to the real world and gave me an inside look of what a bar looks like. I had to check everyone’s ID and do the fastest math I’ve ever done in my life. It was always an adventure when someone paid with coins! </p>

            <p>I did all of these knowing that I wouldn’t get any monetary reward in return. I did it because I wanted to work with a fun group of people, organize paperwork and have a great time doing so. But these skills can also be put on a resume. My snow cone job could be a great example of being a team player and can showcase hospitality skills. I could elaborate on my communication skills and time management abilities with the experiences from the Boys and Girls Club job. Finally, I could show off some conflict resolution tactics and my ability to count change; accomplishments I learned from volunteering at the rodeo. </p>
