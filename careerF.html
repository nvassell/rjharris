                <p class="quote">"Career Fairs are a process and if you’re prepared, you’ll succeed. Figure out who’s going to be there and go in with a plan. Do your homework by looking at the company website. Look at their values, mission statements, creeds, everything. By doing this you gain background information about the company and can have an intelligent conversation with the recruiters. You’ll start off with an advantage over other students."</p>

                <p class="quote">"When I attend Career Fairs, I do a walk-through of the fair first. I start by walking right down the middle and try not to get the recruiters attention. As I’m doing this, I’m look for companies that are familiar, but I also look for unique firms as well. After I finish looking, I go through again with my resume and stop at the ones I’ve made notes of. When that is over, I go through again for a third time to make sure I talked to everyone I wanted to."</p>
